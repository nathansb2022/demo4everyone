# Sign the PowerShell script
# PARAMETERS:
# FilePath - Specifies the file path of the PowerShell script to sign, eg. C:\ATA\myscript.ps1.
# Certificate - Specifies the certificate to use when signing the script.
# TimeStampServer - Specifies the trusted timestamp server that adds a timestamp to your script's digital signature. Adding a timestamp ensures that your code will not expire when the signing certificate expires.
